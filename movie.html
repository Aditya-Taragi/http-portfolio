<h1>Movies Recommanded By ME</h1>

<h2>Anime Movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Your Name</h3>
<p>It was the first Movie I viewed and it was really good.The animations, story, characters everything 
    wonderful and I really recommanded it.
</p>

<h3>2. Silent Voice</h3>
<p>A grade-school student with a hearing impairment is bullied and transfers to another school.
     Years later, the former bully is tormented by his behaviour and sets out to make amends.
    It really made me cry.

<h3>3. I want to eat your Panceras</h3>
<p>One day, "Me" - a highschooler - found a paperback in the hospital. The "Disease Coexistence Journal" 
    was its title. It was a diary that "Me"'s classmate, Sakura Yamauchi, had written in secret. Inside,
    it was written that due to her pancreatic disease, her days were numbered. And thus, "Me" 
    coincidentally went from Just-a-Classmate to a Secret-Knowing-Classmate. It was as if he were being
    drawn to her, who was his polar opposite. However, the world presented the girl that was already 
    suffering from an illness with an equally cruel reality.
